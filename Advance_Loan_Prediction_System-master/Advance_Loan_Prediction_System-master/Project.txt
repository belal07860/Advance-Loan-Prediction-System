SVM over Logistic Regression
For the kernel space, SVM is faster
Logistic sirf classification karta hai jabki svm classfication aur regression dono ue karta hai taki future me agar hume kisi ko kitna limit of loan amount de sakte hai|
The risk of overfitting is less in SVM.

SVM over Decision Tree
Cross Validation show less accuracy (87 to 75)
Highly time consuming in traing phase due to multiple independance variable
Unstable due to high variance and if data will slightly change dramatically prediction produced by thr model

SVM over ANN
ye pehli baar me hi classify kar deta hai hyperplane ke through jabki ann nahi kar pata hai jisse error aa sakti hai consists of longer training time for neural networks
Training time fast hota hai
svm have better generalization capability than ann

svm over random forest
random froest give probability of belonging class jabki SVM gives distance to the boundary
svm works faster
neural network require large number of input data as compared to svm for training
